        I am a Full Stack developer from Caguas, Puerto Rico. I am currently
        finishing my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of
        Rochester. When not working on projects, I enjoy teaching myself new
        technologies.

        My most recent project is Puerto Rico eRacing Clubâ€™s website, where I
        was able to combine my passion for motorsports and development. It
        features a <i>Race Strategy Calculator</i> that, given telemetry on the
        different tyres available, it returns the optimal tyre strategy for a
        given race.
